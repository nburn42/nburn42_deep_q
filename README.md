This is a Deep Q Network running tensorflow.   
It is aimed at running open ai gym.

Network Description:   
2 relu hidden layers with 100 neurons each (overkill)   
Adam optimizer with .01 learning rate   
.95 Discount rate for Q Learning   
a random chance of taking an expolritory action   
chance decays over time   

Note:   
I have not yet optimized those parameters
